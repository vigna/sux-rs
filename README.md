A pure Rust implementation of succinct and compressed data structures.

This crate started as part of the [Sux] project; it contains also code ported
from [the DSI Utilities] and new structures.

## Highlights

- [bit vectors and bit-field vectors];
- several structures for [rank and selection] with different tradeoffs;
- [indexed dictionaries], including an implementation of the popular [Elias–Fano
  representation of monotone sequences], and [lists of strings compressed by
  prefix omission].
- new state-of-the-art structures for [static functions] and [static filters],
  scaling to trillions of keys, and providing very fast queries;
- support for [signed index functions];
- [partial arrays], that is, “arrays with holes”, implemented using ranking or
  Elias–Fano;
- [Compressed lists of integers].

The focus is on performance (e.g., there are unchecked versions of all methods
and support for [unaligned access]) and on flexible composability (e.g., you can
fine-tune your Elias–Fano instance by choosing different types of internal
indices, and whether to index zeros or ones).

## ε-serde Support

All structures in this crate are designed to work well with [ε-serde]: in
particular, once you have created and serialized them, you can easily map them
into memory or load them in memory regions with specific `mmap()` attributes.
Support for ε-serde is provided by the feature `epserde`, and support for
memory mapping in ε-serde is provided by the `mmap` feature.

## serde Support

All structures in this crate support serialization with [serde]. Support is
gated by the feature `serde`.

## Slice by Value Support

Wherever possible, we support the “slice by value” traits from the
[`value-traits`] crate, which make it possible to treat in a manner similar to
slices structures such as bit-field vectors or succinct representations.

## `MemDbg`/`MemSize` Support

All structures in this crate support the [`MemDbg`] and [`MemSize`] traits from
the [`mem_dbg`] crate, which provide convenient facilities for inspecting memory
usage and debugging memory-related issues. For example, this is the output of
`mem_dbg()` on an [`EliasFano`] instance:

## Composability, functoriality, and performance

The design of this crate tries to satisfy the following principles:

- High performance: all implementations try to be as fast as possible (we
  try to minimize cache misses, then tests, and then instructions).
- Composability: all structures are designed to be easily composed with each
  other; structures are built on top of other structures, which
  can be extracted with the usual `into_inner` idiom.
- Zero-cost abstraction: all structures forward conditionally
  `AsRef<[usize]>`, [`BitLength`], and all ranking/selection non-implemented
  methods on the underlying structures.
- Functoriality: whenever possible, there are mapping methods that replace an
  underlying structure with another one, provided it is compatible.

What this crate does not provide:

- High genericity on bit vectors: [bit vectors operations] are based on the
  rather concrete trait combination `AsRef<[usize]>` + [`BitLength`].

## Binaries

A few binaries make it possible to build and serialize structures with ε-serde
(e.g., `rcl`, `vfunc`, and `vfilter`). Moreover, there are examples benchmarking
the structures (e.g., `bench_rear_coded_list`, `bench_vfunc`, and
`bench_vfilter`). You have to use the feature `cli` to build them.

## Features

The crate has the following features:

- `rayon`: enables support for parallel iterators using the `rayon` crate
  (default);
- `flate2`: enables support for gzip-compressed files in the [`lenders`] module
  (default);
- `zstd`: enables support for zstd-compressed files in the [`lenders`] module
  (default);
- `deko`: enables support for the [`deko`] crate, which provides dynamic
  detection of compressed files for the [`lenders`] module;
- `epserde`: enables support for [ε-serde];
- `serde`: enables support for [serde];
- `clap`: enables the `clap` crate for command-line argument parsing;
- `cli`: builds the binaries (implies `clap`, `epserde`, `deko`);
- `mmap`: enables support for memory mapping in ε-serde (implies `epserde`);
- `aarch64_prefetch`: enables prefetch support on aarch64 (requires nightly).

Note: The [`MemDbg`] and [`MemSize`] traits from the [`mem_dbg`] crate are
always available as `mem_dbg` is a required dependency.

## Benchmarks

You can run a number of benchmarks on the structures. Try

```bash
cargo bench --bench sux -- --help
```

to see the available tests. For example, with

```bash
cargo bench --bench sux -- Rank9 -d 0.5 -r 1 -l 100000,1000000,10000000
```

you can test the [`Rank9`] structure with a density of 0.5, using one test
repetition, on a few bit sizes. Afterwards, you can generate an SVG plot and CSV
data in the `plots` directory with

```bash
./python/plot_benches.py --benches-path ./target/criterion/ --plot-dir plots
```

You can then open the `plots/plot.svg` with a browser to see the results, or
inspect the directory `csv` for CSV data. Note that as you run benchmarks, the
results will cumulate in the `target/criterion` directory, so you can generate
plots for multiple runs.

By specifying multiple structures (using also substring matching), you can
compare the behavior of different structures. For example,

```bash
cargo bench --bench sux -- SelectSmall SelectAdapt0 -d 0.5 -r 1 -l 100000,1000000,10000000
```

will test all variants of [`SelectSmall`] against a [`SelectAdapt`] with one (2⁰)
`u64` per subinventory. The plot will highlight the differences in performance:

```bash
./python/plot_benches.py --benches-path ./target/criterion/ --plot-dir plots
```
