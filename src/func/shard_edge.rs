/// Shard and edge logic.
///
/// This trait is used to derive shards and edges from key signatures. Instances
/// are stored, for example, in a [`VFunc`](crate::func::VFunc) or in a
/// [`VBuilder`](crate::func::VBuilder). They contain the data and logic that
/// turns a signature into an edge, and possibly a shard.
///
/// Having this trait makes it possible to test different types of generation
/// techniques for `K`-uniform hypergraphs. Moreover, it decouples entirely the
/// sharding and edge-generation logic from the rest of the code.
///
/// If you compile with the `mwhc` feature, you will get additional
/// implementations for the classic [MWHC
/// construction](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/39.6.547).
///
/// There are a few different implementations depending on the type of graphs,
/// on the size of signatures, and on whether sharding is used. See, for
/// example, [`FuseLge3Shards`].
///
/// The implementation of the [`Display`] trait should return the relevant
/// information about the sharding and edge logic.
///
/// Sometimes sorting signatures by a certain key improves performance when
/// generating a hypergraph. In this case, the implementation of
/// [`num_sort_keys`](ShardEdge::num_sort_keys) should return the number of keys
/// used for sorting, and [`sort_key`](ShardEdge::sort_key) should return the
/// key to be used for sorting.
///
/// Note that [`VBuilder`](crate::func::VBuilder) assumes internally that
/// sorting the signatures themselves gives an order very similar to that
/// obtained sorting by the key returned by [`sort_key`](ShardEdge::sort_key).
